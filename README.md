<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
**API:** [NASA's Mars InSight Weather Data](https://api.nasa.gov/)

What has shaped this rocky planet of the interior Solar System over the last four billion years? This was the question on the minds of those designing each and every small detail on the Mars InSight robotic lander. It influenced every decision they made, and hence formed the attributes of the data we would receive from the red planet.

We will be examining data from a suite of sensors installed on the lander known as the [TWINS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_and_Winds_for_InSight)

These sensors include:
* **Thermometers** for collecting atmospheric temperature information
* **An anemometer** for collecting wind speed and direction information
* **A highly sensitive barometer** for collecting atmospheric pressure information

Together, these tools will allow us to shape a fascinating picture of the Mars' climate and how it relates to our own.

### 3. Versions & Libraries Used
I used **python 2** for this project and suggest that you use it to run all code provided.

There are two libraries (aside from the usual numpy, pandas, etc) that you may need to download for this project to work:
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
* [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/)

These are essential to ensure that my data retrieval and display process works correctly. If there are any problems with the code it may stem from these. Please don't hesitate to contact me!
